Shows a menu of options (add, subtract, multiply, divide, quit)\n","2. Keeps running until the user chooses to quit\n","3. Performs the chosen operation on two numbers\n","\n","\n","## Example Output\n","\n","Here's an example of what it might look like for the calculator to run twice. The first time the user enters \"add\" and then \"17\" and \"23\".\n","\n","```\n","Menu:\n","- add\n","- subtract\n","- multiply\n","- divide\n","- quit\n","Choose an option: add\n","Enter a first number: 17\n","Enter a second number: 23\n","Output: 17 + 23 = 40\n","```\n","\n","In this second example, the user enters an invalid choice, \"exponent\" and an error message is displayed and the Menue is displayed again.\n","\n","```\n","Menu:\n","- add\n","- subtract\n","- multiply\n","- divide\n","- quit\n","Choose an option: exponent\n","Error: exponent is not an option\n","\n","Menu:\n","- add\n","- subtract\n","- multiply\n","- divide\n","- quit\n","Choose an option: quit\n","Goodbye!\n","```\n","\n","This calculator should validate that the option that was select is correct and keep providing the menue until it is.\n","\n","\n","**Do the above FIRST before attempting anythinge below.**\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Hard Mode\n","\n","- Make the calculator run in a loop until quit, when it's done calculating something, it should loop back to the original menu.\n","- Support `mod` (`%`) and `exponent` (`**`) as options.\n","\n","## Very Hard Mode\n","\n","Only attempt this after you've done all of the above.\n","\n","- Make it work like a real calcualtor does. Mark \"Input:\" and \"Output:\". Display the number that the user inputs. Then they input `+`, `-`, `/`, `*`, `**`, or `%`, then another number and it imemdiately calculates the result.\n","- Instead of `quit` support `clear` so that the user can undo their first number entry.\n","- Allow users to chain together calculations.\n","\n","Example of this all together:\n","```\n","Input:  7\n","Output: 7\n","Input:  +\n","Output: 7\n","Input:  7\n","Output: 14\n","Input:  +\n","Output: 7\n","Input:  6\n","Output: 18\n","Input:  clear\n","Output: 0\n","Input:  -\n","Output: 0\n","Input:  15\n","Output: -15\n","```"],"metadata":{"id":"5iZf87PTm_le"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["while True:\n","    print(\"Menu:\")\n","    print(\"- add\")\n","    print(\"- subtract\")\n","    print(\"- multiply\")\n","    print(\"- divide\")\n","    print(\"- quit\")\n","\n","    choice = input(\"Choose an option: \")\n","\n","    if choice == \"quit\":\n","        print(\"Goodbye!\")\n","        break\n","\n","    first_value = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n","    second_value = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"MmHvlI-6pJpT"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
