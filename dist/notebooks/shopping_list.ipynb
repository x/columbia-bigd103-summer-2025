This assignment will practice lists, functions, and user interaction.\n","\n","## Core Requirements\n","\n","Your shopping list app must have these features:\n","\n","### Part 1: Basic Functions\n","\n","Write the following functions:\n","\n","1. **`display_list(shopping_list)`** - Shows all items in the list\n","   ```python\n","   # Example output:\n","   Shopping List:\n","   1. Milk\n","   2. Bread\n","   3. Eggs\n","   ```\n","\n","2. **`add_item(shopping_list, item)`** - Adds an item to the list\n","   - Don't add duplicates (check if item already exists)\n","   - Return True if added, False if duplicate\n","\n","3. **`remove_item(shopping_list, item_number)`** - Removes item by position\n","   - Remember: display shows 1-based numbers, but lists are 0-indexed!\n","   - Return True if removed, False if invalid number\n","\n","### Part 2: Main Program\n","\n","Create a menu-driven program:\n","```\n","=== SHOPPING LIST MANAGER ===\n","1.
