Computer picks a random number between 1 and 100\n","2. Player gets 10 attempts to guess\n","3. After each wrong guess, tell them if the secret number is higher or lower\n","4. If they guess correctly, they win!\n","5. If they run out of guesses, they lose\n","\n","### Example Game Play\n","\n","```\n","Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!\n","I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\n","You have 10 guesses.\n","\n","Guess 1: 50\n","Too low! The secret number is higher.\n","\n","Guess 2: 75\n","Too high! The secret number is lower.\n","\n","Guess 3: 62\n","Too low! The secret number is higher.\n","\n","Guess 4: 68\n","Congratulations! You got it in 4 guesses!\n","```\n","\n","### Getting Started\n","\n","```python\n","# Import random number generator\n","from random import randint\n","\n","# Generate secret number\n","secret_number = randint(1, 100)\n","\n","# Game loop\n","for guess_count in range(10):\n","    # Get player's guess\n","    guess = int(input(f\"Guess {guess_count}: \"))\n","```\n","\n","### Key Functions You'll Need\n","\n","**Random number:**\n","\n","This is something new, but here we're `import`-ing a new helpful function, `randint` which returns a random number from within a range.\n","\n","```python\n","from random import randint\n","secret = randint(1, 100)  # Random number from 1 to 100\n","```\n","\n","**Getting user input as a number:**\n","You'll want to covnert the guess into an integer to match the secret.\n","\n","```python\n","guess = int(input(\"Enter your guess: \"))\n","```\n","\n","**Loop for 10 attempts:**\n","The user will have 10 attemps\n","\n","```python\n","for attempt in range(10):\n","    # This runs 10 times with attempt = 1, 2, 3... 10\n","```\n","\n","### Tips\n","- Use `break` to exit the loop when they guess correctly\n","- The `else` in `if/elif/else` handles the \"too high\" case\n","- Consider adding a `print` statement to \"whisper\" the secret number to you as you're working out the kinks in your game.\n","\n","### Bonus Challenges\n","1. Tell them how many guesses they have left after each attempt\n","2. Ask the user for a difficulty level (easy: 1-50, medium: 1-100, hard: 1-200)\n","3. Add a play again feature using a while loop and keep track of their lowest number of guesses.\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"iQA_yP3WqobK"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Import random number generator\n","from random import randint\n","\n","# Choose Difficulty\n","while True:\n","    difficulty = input(\"What is your difficulty level (easy, medium, hard)? \")\n","    if difficulty == \"easy\":\n","        max_randint = 50\n","        break\n","    elif difficulty == \"medium\":\n","        max_randint = 100\n","        break\n","    elif difficulty == \"hard\":\n","        max_randint = 200\n","        break\n","    else:\n","        print(f\"Invalid difficulty '{difficulty}'\")\n","\n","max_guesses = 10\n","best_score = max_guesses + 1\n","\n","while True:\n","\n","    # Generate secret number\n","    secret_number = randint(1, max_randint)\n","\n","    # Game loop\n","    for guess_count in range(1, max_guesses + 1):\n","        guess = int(input(f\"Guess {guess_count}: \"))\n","\n","        # Hints\n","        if guess < secret_number:\n","            print(\"WRONG!
