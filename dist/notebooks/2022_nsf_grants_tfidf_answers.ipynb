This funding was diverted toward _questionable projects that promoted Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) or advanced neo-Marxist class warfare propaganda._\n","\n","You will:\n","1. Load two datasets of NSF grants\n","2. Preprocess grant descriptions\n","3. Implement Subset TF-IDF to find distinctive terms\n","4.

Detailed, year-by-year records of all grants since 2008 are available for download:\n","\n","https://www.usaspending.gov/download_center/award_data_archive\n","\n","This dataset is much larger, more detailed, and most importantly, includes the missing information about the non-woke grants needed to build our corpus for TF-IDF.\n","\n","Interesting Columns:\n","\n","- `award_id_fain` - Unique award identifier (join key)\n","- `total_obligated_amount` - Total grant obligated amount\n","- `prime_award_base_transaction_description` - Award description\n","- `recipient_name` - Name of the recipient (often the university name)\n","- `recipient_state_name` - State of the award recipient\n","- `recipient_city_name` - City of the award recipient\n","- `cfda_title` - Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance title (area of research)\n","\n","**Note:** Because these datasets are large, I focused on just the 2022 grants. If you're interested, I encourage you to extend this exercise by incorporating other years.\n","\n","In this cell we will:\n","- Pull both datasets from our shared Google Drive folder.\n","- Use the \"woke\" dataset to add a new boolean column, `is_woke`, to our dataset.
