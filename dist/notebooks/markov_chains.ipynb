It is characterized by the memoryless property, which means that the next state depends only on the current state and not on the sequence of events that preceded it.\n","\n","https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain\n","\n","## Generating Text with Markov Chains\n","One fun application of Markov chains is to generate text that sounds like it was written by a particular author. If we have lots of text written by someone with a distinct voice and vocabulary, we can use it to calculate probabilities that one word will follow the next, then we can use those probabilities to \"autocomple\" next words.\n","\n","\n","\n","Here's how it works:\n","\n","**States:**\n","The words in the text are treated as states.\n","\n","**Transitions:**\n","The transitions between states are the occurrences of words following each other in the text. Each word has a probability of being followed by other words, based on how often that transition occurs in the corpus.\n","\n","**Transition Probabilities:**\n","By analyzing the text, we calculate the probabilities of each word following another word. This is done by counting how many times each word follows another and then converting these counts into probabilities.\n","\n","**Text Generation:**\n","Starting with an initial word (state), the Markov chain uses the transition probabilities to randomly choose the next word.\n","\n","This process is repeated to generate a sequence of words, creating a new piece of text that mimics the style and structure of the original corpus.\n","\n","**Example:**\n","\n","Here's a very simple example using simple python that you should be able to read and recognize.\n","\n","```python\n","import random\n","\n","# Step 1: Initialize a list of words\n","word_list = [\n","    \"the\", \"cat\", \"in\", \"the\", \"hat\", \"the\", \"cat\", \"on\", \"the\", \"mat\",\n","    \"the\", \"dog\", \"and\", \"the\", \"cat\", \"the\", \"cat\", \"and\", \"the\", \"hat\"\n","]\n","\n","# Step 2: Calculate the transition probabilities\n","transitions = {}\n","\n","# Populate the transitions dictionary with counts\n","for i in range(len(word_list) - 1):\n","    current_word = word_list[i]\n","    next_word = word_list[i + 1]\n","    if current_word not in transitions:\n","        transitions[current_word] = {}\n","    if next_word not in transitions[current_word]:\n","        transitions[current_word][next_word] = 0\n","    transitions[current_word][next_word] += 1\n","\n","# Convert counts to probabilities\n","for current_word, next_words in transitions.items():\n","    total = sum(next_words.values())\n","    for next_word in next_words:\n","        transitions[current_word][next_word] /= total\n","\n","# Step 3: Implement the function to generate the next word\n","def next_word(current_word):\n","    if current_word not in transitions:\n","        return random.choice(list(transitions.keys()))\n","    probabilities = transitions[current_word]\n","    next_words = list(probabilities.keys())\n","    probabilities = list(prbabilities.values())\n","    return random.choices(next_words, probabilities)[0]\n","\n","# Step 4: Generate a sequence of words\n","def generate_sequence(start_word, length):\n","    sequence = [start_word]\n","    current_word = start_word\n","    for _ in range(length - 1):\n","        current_word = next_word(current_word)\n","        sequence.append(current_word)\n","    return sequence\n","\n","# Example usage\n","start_word = \"the\"\n","length = 20\n","sequence = generate_sequence(start_word, length)\n","print(\"Generated sequence:\", sequence)\n","```\n","\n","## Assignment\n","\n","1.
