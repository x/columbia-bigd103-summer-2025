This assignment will practice dictionaries, lists, functions, and user interaction.\n","\n","## Core Requirements\n","\n","Your shopping cart app must track both items and their costs using dictionaries.\n","\n","### Part 1: Basic Functions\n","\n","Write the following functions:\n","\n","1. **`display_cart(cart)`** - Shows all items with prices and total\n","   ```python\n","   # Example output:\n","   Shopping Cart:\n","   1. Milk - 3.99\n","   2. Bread - 2.49\n","   3. Eggs - 4.99\n","   \n","   Total: $11.47\n","   ```\n","\n","2. **`add_to_cart(cart, item, price)`** - Adds an item with its price\n","   - If item already exists, update the price (ask user to confirm)\n","   - Return True if added/updated, False otherwise\n","\n","3. **`remove_from_cart(cart, item_number)`** - Removes item by position\n","   - Remember: display shows 1-based numbers!\n","   - Return the price of removed item (or 0 if invalid)\n","\n","4. **`calculate_total(cart)`** - Returns the total cost of all items\n","\n","### Part 2: Main Program\n","\n","Create a menu-driven program:\n","```\n","=== SHOPPING CART ===\n","Current total: $0.00\n","\n","1.
