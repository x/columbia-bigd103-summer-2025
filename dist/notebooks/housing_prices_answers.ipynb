Open [this link to our shared datasets folder](https://bigd103.link/datasets) in a new tab\n","2. Click the dropdown arrow next to \"datasets\" at the top\n","3. Select **\"Organize\"** → **\"Add shortcut\"**\n","4. Choose **All Locations** and then **\"My Drive\"** as the location\n","5. Click **\"Add\"**\n","\n","You should now see \"datasets\" in your Google Drive!\n","\n","### Step 2: Connect Colab to Your Drive\n","\n","In your Colab notebook, run this code to access your Google Drive:\n","\n","```python\n","# Connect to Google Drive\n","from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount(\"/content/gdrive\")\n","```\n","\n","When prompted:\n","- Click the link\n","- Choose your Google account\n","- Allow access\n","- Copy the authorization code back to Colab\n","\n","### Step 3: Load the House Price Data\n","\n","```python\n","# Open and read the file\n","file_content =

**Q2**: 50th percentile (the median)\n","- **Q3**: 75th percentile (75% of houses cost less)\n","\n","```python\n","# Sort the data first!\n","sorted_prices = sorted(prices)\n","n =
