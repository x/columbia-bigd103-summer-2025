Ask the user for their test score (0-100)\n","2. Determine their letter grade using these ranges:\n","   - 90-100: A\n","   - 80-89: B\n","   - 70-79: C\n","   - 60-69: D\n","   - Below 60: F\n","3. For each grade, also print:\n","   - A custom message about their performance\n","   - How many points they need for the next grade level (except for A)\n","   - If they got an A with 100 points, print a special \"Perfect Score!\" message\n","\n","### Example Output\n","\n","```\n","Enter your test score: 82\n","Your grade: B\n","Good job! You're doing well.\n","You need 8 more points for an A.\n","```\n","\n","```\n","Enter your test score: 100\n","Your grade: A\n","Excellent work!\n","Perfect Score!

Add input validation: make sure the score is between 0 and 100\n","2. Add plus/minus grades (A+ for 97-100, A for 93-96, A- for 90-92, etc.)"],"metadata":{"id":"Mn8TcZ6miQKx"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Get the score\n","score = int(input(\"Enter your test score: \"))\n","\n","# Determine grade and feedback\n","if score >= 90:\n","    grade = \"A\"\n","    message = \"Excellent work!\"\n","\n","\n","print(f\"Your score: {score}/100\")\n","print(f\"Your grade: {grade}\")\n","print(message)"],"metadata":{"id":"yf88QuzniT8-"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
