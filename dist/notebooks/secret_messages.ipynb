Your job is to build a Caesar cipher system that can encode and decode secret messages. We'll provide special conversion functions to help you work with the encrypted data.\n","\n","### Background: Caesar Cipher\n","A Caesar cipher shifts each letter by a fixed number. With a shift of 3:\n","- `a → d`, `b → e`, `c → f`...\n","- `x → a`, `y → b`, `z → c` (wraps around!)\n","\n","### Provided Functions\n","```python\n","def letter_to_number(letter):\n","    return ord(letter.lower()) - 97\n","\n","def number_to_letter(number):\n","    return chr(number + 97)\n","```\n","\n","### Your Task\n","Write two functions:\n","```python\n","def encrypt(message):\n","    # 1. Convert message to number list\n","    # 2. Shift each letter's number by 3\n","    # 3. Handle wrap-around (z → c)\n","    # 4. Convert back to string\n","    \n","def decrypt(message):\n","    # Do the reverse!\n","```\n","\n","### Key Hints\n","- To keep things simple, stick to lowercase letters\n","- Use modulo for wrap-around: `(value + 3) % 26`\n","- Do not change `\" \"`\n","\n","### Example\n","```python\n","secret = encrypt(\"meet at dawn\")\n","print(secret)  # Should print: \"phhw dw gdzq\"\n","print(decrypt(secret))  # Should print: \"meet at dawn\"\n","```\n","\n","### Hard Mode ([Caesar's Cipher, 58 BCE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher))\n","\n","Your functions should now accept a secret key - the number of positions to shift. This key would be shared between the two parties sending messages.\n","\n","```python\n","def encrypt(message, key):\n","    # Shift by 'key' positions instead of 3\n","    \n","def decrypt(message, key):\n","    # Shift back by 'key' positions\n","\n","# Example:\n","secret = encrypt(\"meet at dawn\", 5)\n","print(secret)              # Should print: \"rjjy fy ifbs\"\n","print(decrypt(secret, 5))  # Should print: \"meet at dawn\"\n","```\n","\n","### Very Hard Mode ([Vigenère Cipher, 1553 AD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher))\n","\n","Now the key is a word! Each letter in the key determines how much to shift the corresponding letter in the message.\n","\n","How it works:\n","- Key letters represent shifts: `a=0, b=1, c=2... z=25`\n","- The key repeats to match the message length\n","- Each message letter shifts by its corresponding key letter\n","\n","```python\n","def encrypt(message, key_word):\n","    # Each letter shifts by different amount\n","    \n","def decrypt(message, key_word):\n","    # Reverse the process\n","\n","# Example:\n","secret = encrypt(\"meetatdawn\", \"cat\")  \n","# 'm' shifts by 2 (c), 'e' by 0 (a), 'e' by 19 (t),\n","# 't' by 2 (c), 'a' by 0 (a), 't' by 19 (t)...\n","print(secret)              # Should print: \"oetkttftwg\"\n","print(decrypt(secret, \"cat\"))  # Should print: \"meetatdawn\"\n","```"],"metadata":{"id":"mY3OeRoEBBPG"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def letter_to_number(letter):\n","    return ord(letter.lower()) - 97\n","\n","def number_to_letter(number):\n","    return chr(number + 97)\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"L6AB_vSeDoRr"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
