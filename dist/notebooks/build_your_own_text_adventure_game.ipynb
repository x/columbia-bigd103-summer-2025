They can type commands to:\n","- Move to new locations\n","- Pick up items\n","- Complete actions\n","\n","The game ends when they reach the final location with the right items.\n","\n","\n","## Working with a Partner\n","\n","**I encourage you to work with a partner for this assignment.** Two brains are better than one. But if you'd like to work alone, that's OK too.\n","\n","\n","## Part 1: Create Your Story\n","\n","First, think of a story you want to tell. Your story needs:\n","- A unique setting (where does it happen?)\n","- A clear goal (what must the player do to win?)\n","\n","Examples:\n","- Escape from the Mudd building\n","- A warrior escaping a dungeon  \n","- A mouse finding cheese in a maze\n","\n","**Be creative!** Make your own story.\n","\n","## Part 2: Making Multiple Rooms\n","\n","Here's a simple game with three locations:\n","\n","```python\n","def location_1():\n","    print(\"You're in a beautiful field.\")\n","    print(\"ACTION MENU:\")\n","    print(\"- walk east\")\n","    print(\"- walk west\")\n","    action = input(\"INPUT ACTION: \")\n","    if action == \"walk east\":\n","        print(\"You walk east towards a house.\")\n","        location_2()\n","    elif action == \"walk west\":\n","        location_1()\n","    else:\n","        print(f\"Invalid action: {action}\")\n","        location_1()\n","\n","def location_2():\n","    print(\"You see a house with a locked door.\")\n","    print(\"ACTION MENU:\")\n","    print(\"- walk west\")\n","    action = input(\"INPUT ACTION: \")\n","    if action == \"walk west\":\n","        location_1()\n","    else:\n","        print(f\"Invalid action: {action}\")\n","        location_2()\n","\n","def location_3():\n","    print(\"You enter the house. You won!\")\n","\n","# Start the game\n","location_1()\n","```\n","\n","**Your task:**\n","1. Make each room a function\n","2. Use function calls to move between rooms\n","3. If the player types a wrong command, repeat the current room\n","4. Create a final room that ends the game\n","\n","## Part 3: Adding a Lose Condition\n","\n","Your game needs a way to lose. Add a `game_over()` function:\n","\n","```python\n","def game_over():\n","    print(\"GAME OVER\")\n","\n","def location_1():\n","    # ... other code ...\n","    elif action == \"walk west\":\n","        print(\"You fall into a hole.\")\n","        game_over()\n","```\n","\n","## Part 4: Adding Inventory\n","\n","Let's track what items the player has. We use function arguments to pass inventory between rooms:\n","\n","```python\n","def location_1(has_key):\n","    print(\"You're in a beautiful field.\")\n","    if not has_key:\n","        print(\"A key is on the ground.\")\n","    \n","    print(\"ACTION MENU:\")\n","    print(\"- walk east\")\n","    print(\"- walk west\")\n","    if not has_key:\n","        print(\"- pickup key\")\n","    \n","    action = input(\"INPUT ACTION: \")\n","    \n","    if action == \"walk east\":\n","        print(\"You walk east towards a house.\")\n","        location_2(has_key)\n","    elif action == \"walk west\":\n","        print(\"You walk west. The field continues.\")\n","        location_1(has_key)\n","    elif action == \"pickup key\" and not has_key:\n","        print(\"You pick up the key.\")\n","        has_key = True\n","        location_1(has_key)\n","    else:\n","        print(f\"Invalid action: {action}\")\n","        location_1(has_key)\n","\n","def location_2(has_key):\n","    print(\"You see a house with a locked door.\")\n","    print(\"ACTION MENU:\")\n","    print(\"- walk west\")\n","    if has_key:\n","        print(\"- use key\")\n","    \n","    action = input(\"INPUT ACTION: \")\n","    \n","    if action == \"walk west\":\n","        location_1(has_key)\n","    elif action == \"use key\" and has_key:\n","        location_3(has_key)\n","    else:\n","        print(f\"Invalid action: {action}\")\n","        location_2(has_key)\n","\n","def location_3(has_key):\n","    print(\"You enter the house. You won!\")\n","\n","# Start the game\n","has_key = False\n","location_1(has_key)\n","```\n","\n","### Tips for Inventory:\n","\n","1. **Multiple items:** Add more arguments\n","   ```python\n","   def location_1(has_key, has_sword, has_map):\n","       # ... your code ...\n","   ```\n","\n","2. **Different types:** Use numbers and strings too\n","   ```python\n","   def location_1(health, gold_coins, player_name):\n","       # health = 100 (number)\n","       # gold_coins = 5 (number)\n","       # player_name = \"Alex\" (string)\n","   ```\n","\n","3. **Track events:** Use inventory to remember what happened\n","   ```python\n","   def location_1(talked_to_wizard, door_is_open):\n","       # talked_to_wizard = True/False\n","       # door_is_open = True/False\n","   ```\n","\n","\n","## BONUS: Improve your Input Handling\n","\n","Want to avoid repeating code? Consider writing a function to handle your menus:\n","\n","```python\n","def three_action_menu(action_1, action_2, action_3):\n","    print(\"ACTION MENU:\")\n","    print(f\"1. {action_1}\")\n","    print(f\"2. {action_2}\")\n","    print(f\"3. {action_3}\")\n","    while True:\n","        action = input(\"INPUT ACTION: \")\n","        if action == \"1\" or action == action_1:\n","            return 1\n","        elif action == \"2\" or action == action_2:\n","            return 2\n","        elif action == \"3\" or action == action_3:\n","            return 3\n","        else:\n","            print(f\"INVALID ACTION '{action}'\")\n","\n","def location_1():\n","    print(\"You're in a beautiful field.\")\n","    action = three_action_menu(\"walk east\", \"walk west\", \"sit\")\n","    if action == 1:\n","        print(\"You walk east.\")\n","        location_2()\n","    elif action == 2:\n","        print(\"You walk west.\")\n","        location_1()\n","    elif action == 3:\n","        print(\"You sit and rest.\")\n","        location_1()\n","```\n","\n","**Note:** In the above example, `three_action_menu` works only when you have exactly three options. There are ways for functions to have a variable number of arguments, but we haven't learned these yet.\n","\n","\n","## BONUS: Add Random Events\n","\n","Make your game more interesting with randomness:\n","\n","```python\n","from random import randint\n","\n","# Random chance to find items\n","def location_1():\n","    chance = randint(0, 10)\n","    if chance > 7:\n","        print(\"You notice a key on the ground!\")\n","\n","# Dice rolling mini-game\n","def roll_dice():\n","    result = randint(1, 6)\n","    print(f\"You rolled a {result}\")\n","    return result\n","\n","# Combat system\n","from random import randint\n","\n","def attack(target_hp, has_sword):\n","    if has_sword:\n","        damage = randint(3, 10)\n","    else:\n","        damage = randint(0, 4)\n","    target_hp = target_hp - damage\n","    return target_hp\n","\n","def combat(player_hp, enemy_hp, has_sword):\n","    while True:\n","        print(f\"PLAYER HP: {player_hp} / ENEMY HP: {enemy_hp}\")\n","        action = input(\"INPUT ACTION (attack, run): \")\n","\n","        if action == \"attack\":\n","            print(\"PLAYER ATTACKS\")\n","            enemy_hp = attack(enemy_hp, has_sword)\n","            if enemy_hp <= 0:\n","                return True # You won!\n","\n","        elif action == \"run\":\n","            print(\"PLAYER RAN\")\n","            return False\n","\n","        # Enemy attacks with a 50% chance\n","        if randint(0, 1) == 1:\n","            print(\"ENEMY ATTACKS\")\n","            player_hp = attack(player_hp, False)\n","            if player_hp <= 0:\n","                return False # You were defeated\n","\n","def location_1(hp, has_sword, slayed_the_dragon):\n","    if slayed_the_dragon:\n","        print(\"No dragon here.
