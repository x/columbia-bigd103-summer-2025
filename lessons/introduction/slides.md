## What is this Class?

> Data science and machine learning are exciting and popular disciplines. While different fields, they work best in sync to help change the way humans think, behave, and interact. In fact, some of the most popular data science methods stem from machine learning. Through this course, students will be introduced to the foundations of both science areas and explore available career opportunities. Beginning with an overview of the landscape and real-world applications, students will learn how data science and machine learning impact the world in which we live, every day. Further, students will gain hands-on experience with introductory coding using Python and become versed in popular machine learning algorithms. By the end of the course, students will use their benchmark knowledge to analyze and present data ethically and effectively. Finally, students will leave the course prepared for more advanced practice in data science and machine learning.

## What's the Difference from `BIGD204`?

**`BIGD204` is not _really_ a continuation of `BIGD103`.**

- `BIGD204` is a more advanced class for students who already have a strong foundation in Python and/or Data Science and Machine Learning.
- Each professor teaches this class differently.

**We will spend the first third of this class building our programming Python skills.**

- I will try to scaffold the assignments but, if you already have a strong foundation, you may find the first week slow!
- Things will pick up quickly after that.

**If, in the first week, you feel `BIGD204` would be a better fit for you, you can switch!**

## Using ChatGPT and other AI in this class

1. I'm going to treat you like adults.
2. You will not learn if AI writes your code.
3. I will know if AI wrote your code.

Everyone in this class should feel comfortable using AI tools to help them learn.

- Clarify concepts.
- Debug issues.
- Give examples.

**But you should be writing your own code.**
