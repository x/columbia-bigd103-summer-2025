# Loops

Making Code Repeat

---

## Why Do We Need Loops?

Imagine calculating tips for 100 restaurant bills (for simplicity, let's say each bill is $25 with a 20% tip):

```python {monaco-run} {autorun: false}
total = 0
total = total + (25 * 1.20)  # Bill 1
print(f"Total after Bill 1: {total})

total = total + (25 * 1.20)  # Bill 2
print(f"Total after Bill 2: {total})

total = total + (25 * 1.20)  # Bill 3
print(f"Total after Bill 3: {total})

# ... 97 more times?!
```

Loops let us repeat code efficiently!

---

## The `while` Loop

Repeats code while a condition is True:

```python {monaco-run} {autorun: false}
count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print(f"Count is {count}")
    count = count + 1

print("Done!")
```

---

## `while` Loop Example

```python {monaco-run} {autorun: false}
bill_count = 1
total = 0
while bill_count <= 5:
    bill = 25 * 1.20  # 20% tip
    total = total + bill
    print(f"Total after Bill {bill_count}: {total:.2f}")
    bill_count = bill_count + 1
```


---

## `while` Loop Structure

```python {monaco-run} {autorun: false}
while condition:
    # Code to repeat
    # Must eventually make condition False!
```

**Warning:** If the condition never becomes False, you get an infinite loop!

```python
x = 1
while x > 0:
    print("Help, I'm stuck!")
    # x never changes, so this runs forever
```

---

## The `for` Loop - Your New Best Friend

Perfect for repeating code a specific number of times:

```python {monaco-run} {autorun: false}
for i in range(5):
    print(f"This is iteration {i}")
```


---

## Understanding `range()`

`range()` creates a sequence of numbers:

```python {monaco-run} {autorun: false}
for num in range(5):
    print(num)

for num in range(1, 6):
    print(num)
```

**Note:** `range(n)` goes from 0 to n-1!

---

## `range()` with Start and Stop

```python {monaco-run} {autorun: false}
for num in range(5):
for i in range(3, 8):
    print(i)  # Prints: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

for bill in range(10, 51, 10):
    total = bill * 1.20  # 20% tip
    print(f"Bill: ${bill}, Total: ${total:.2f}")
```

---

## Loop Variable Names

The loop variable can be any name:

```python {monaco-run} {autorun: false}
# Common: i, j, k for simple counters
for i in range(3):
    print(f"Loop {i}")

# Descriptive names are better!
for student_number in range(1, 31):
    print(f"Welcome, Student {student_number}")

for day in range(1, 8):
    print(f"Day {day} of the week")
```

---

## Loops with Conditionals

Combining loops with if statements:

```python {monaco-run} {autorun: false}
# Print only even numbers
for num in range(10):
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print(f"{num} is even")
    else:
        print(f"{num} is odd")

# Grade multiple students
for student in range(1, 6):
    score = 70 + student * 5  # Simulated scores
    if score >= 90:
        print(f"Student {student}: A")
    elif score >= 80:
        print(f"Student {student}: B")
    else:
        print(f"Student {student}: C")
```

## Breaking Out of Loops

::left::

Use `break` to exit early:

```python {monaco-run} {autorun: false}
# Find first number divisible by 7
for num in range(1, 100):
    if num % 7 == 0:
        print(f"Found it: {num}")
        break

# Password checker with limited attempts
for attempt in range(3):
    password = input("Enter password: ")
    if password == "secret":
        print("Access granted!")
        break
    else:
        print(f"Wrong! {2 - attempt} tries left")
```

::right::

This is a solution for forever-`while` loops!

```python {monaco-run} {autorun: false}
print("Do you like chocolate?")

while True:
    answer = input("Type 'yes' or 'no': ")
    if answer.lower() == "yes":
        print("Great! Chocolate is awesome!")
        break
    elif answer.lower() == "no":
        print("Are you sure?")
    else:
        print("Please type 'yes' or 'no'.")
```

## Common Loop Patterns

::left::

### Counting

```python
count = 0
for i in range(100):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        count = count + 1
print(f"Found {count} even numbers")
```

### Accumulating

```python
total = 0
for num in range(1, 11):
    total = total + num
print(f"Sum of 1-10: {total}")
```

::right::

### Finding maximum

```python
numbers = [45, 67, 23, 89, 12]
biggest = numbers[0]
for num in numbers:
    if num > biggest:
        biggest = num
print(f"Biggest: {biggest}")
```

### Parsing Input

```python
answer = False
while True:
    response = input("What's your answer? (yes/no): ")
    if response == "yes":
        answer = True
        break
    elif response == "no":
        answer = False
        break
    else:
        print("Please type 'yes' or 'no'.")
```

---

## Nested Loops

Just like conditions, we can nest loops inside loops:

```python {monaco-run} {autorun: false}
# Multiplication table
for i in range(1, 4):
    for j in range(1, 4):
        result = i * j
        print(f"{i} Ã— {j} = {result}")
    print()  # Empty line between sections
```
